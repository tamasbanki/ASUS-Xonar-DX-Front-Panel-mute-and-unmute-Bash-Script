# ASUS Xonar DX Front Panel mute/unmute Bash script
#
### This little bash script helps you to change change between the front output and rear output on ASUS Xonar DX sound cards.
### (Maybe it works with other sound cards, but I didn't tested it.)
#
### You'll need ALSA with amixer utility!
#
### Installation:
##### 1.   Put this script file somewhere (like "/home/user/scripts/")
##### 2.   Open the terminal in the script file's folder
##### 3.   Make the script executable with ```$chmod +x alsa-fp-switch.sh```
##### 4.   Run the script with ```./alsa-fp-switch.sh```
##### (5.) Create a shortcut with ```Exec= /path/to/file/alsa-fp-switch.sh```
##### or a keyboard shortcut like "Ctrl + Alt + s"
